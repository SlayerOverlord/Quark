# Quark
My first major project in C++, an application engine, to test my skills as well as learning how to build engines primarily for game development.

As this is my first approach in building an application engine, do expect many bugs, redundant files, and inefficient code. If you are using this
engine and encounter something that could be fixed/ improved, please let me know. I am currently a student studying electrical engineering, and 
whilst programming may not be my main focus, I am very eager to learn new and better ways to improve existing code or learn new coding consepts to
assist in the development or further the progress of this project.

Anyone wishing to use my code may do so as long as you follow the license, and if you wish to review this code, please leave me a message on how
you think I can improve or what you would like to see added.

Thank you for taking your time to read this file and have fun with my project!
